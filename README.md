you cant run it from anywhere and you'll have to build it yourself so yes 

just do (make sure you have rust installed):
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/gushtichudi/skiddie-nitro-link-generator.git \
> cd skiddie-nitro-link-generator \
> cargo build \
> ./target/debug/skiddie-nitro-link-generator
```
